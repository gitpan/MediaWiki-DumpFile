Revision history for MediaWiki-DumpFile

0.2.0
  * No longer depends on XML::CompactTree::XS but does recommend it.
    Just install it via CPAN and it will be used automatically to make things faster. 
  * Fast mode is here! ::Pages, ::FastPages, and ::Compat::Pages can 
    all be very fast by giving up support for everything besides
    titles and the text contents of the first entry in the dump file. 
  * Resolved bug #63453 "categories() does not work in MediaWiki::DumpFile::Compat"
  * MediaWiki::DumpFile::Compat did not perform caching on methods like Parse::MediaWikiDump did
    also from bug #63453
  * Added in formal error messages for a few events, most notably when
    the page dump version changes to an unknown one. Now the user is
    directed to our documentation where there is explicit instructions
    on how to report a bug and override the case where it will not run
    with an environment variable
  * Added the XML benchmarking suite I created to study XML processing speeds
    to distro; hopefully more people will be interested in the shootout. 
  * Ported over documentation from Parse::MediaWikiDump giving ::Compat
    full documentation in this module as well. 
  * ::Compat::page now uses optimized regex caching and compilation
